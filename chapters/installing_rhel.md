### Linux

Red Hat, Inc. released their OS Red Hat Linux (RHL) under the GNU GPL in 1994. There are two 100% rebuilds of RHEL. These are CentOS and Scientific Linux. 

* The initial realse of RHEL7 is based on kernel version 3.10
* The RHEL7 installation program is called Anaconda
* Anaconda provides three main interfaces: graphical, text-based and kickstart
* Text-based is used on systems with no graphics cards where kickstart is fully-automated method that could be used to load a number of systems at the same time 
* RHEL7 is supported with 64-bit Intel, AMD, IBM Power7 andIBM System zEnterprise processors
* There are six text-based virtual console screens for monitoring the installation (accessible via `Ctrl+Alt+F[1:6]`)

```
# to enable the GUI on a system 
yum group install "X Window System" "GNOME" -y
systemctl set-default graphical.target
sudo shutdown -r now
```

#### RHEL-8 Server Installation

RHEL can be deployed various ways:
* Installing on physical hardware
* Installing on virtual machine
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux as a container
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux as a cloud instance

#### Using VMware

1. Download VMware Fusion for mac and choose the free license for 30 days option
2. Download the CentOS8 image from Centos
3. Create a new image. Ensure VMware is able to run in System Preferences -> Security
4. The software selection can be 'Minimal Install'
5. Accept 'Installation Destination' defaults and 'Begin Installation'
6. Add the root password along with a user

#### Install GNOME Desktop on Minimal Server from DVD 

```bash
# login as root
su -
# create a directory
mkdir /dvdinstall
# check which device has the DVD
lsblk
# mount drive (dirve must be formatting usnig parted/fdisk)
mount /dev/sr0 /dvdinstall
# check 
df -h
# go to the repo defintion and create a file
cd /etc/yum.repos.d
vi dvdinstall.repo
```

Add the following:

```
[BaseOS]
name=BaseOS
baseurl=file:///{location}
gpgcheck=0
enable=1

[AppStream]
name=AppStream
baseurl=file:///{location}
gpgcheck=0
enable=1
```

In this case I had to remove other repos to make this work first:

```bash
  mv CentOS-AppStream/repo /tmp/
  mv CentOS-Base.repo /tmp/
  yum clean all
  yum repolist
  yum -y groupinstall "Server with GUI"
  # set default boot to be graphic
  systemctl set-default graphical-target
  reboot
```

#### Using Virtualbox

A few key points and not a full guide. This allows for a GUI installation which is needed for elements of the exam.

1. Download Virtualbox
2. Download CentOS Image
3. Create a New virtual machine and accept the default options
3. Attach the OS ISO image as a disk (Settings -> Storage -> Add Optic Drive)
4. The Installation Summary screen appears
5. Choose Software Selection -> `Server with GUI`
6. Configure IP and Hostname 
7. Add a root password and a users
8. Confirm the post installation tasks

#### Creating automated labs

Using VirtualBox is buggy and slow. An easier way using just the CLI:

* [Creating the labs Using Vagrant](https://github.com/AnwarYagoub/RHCSA-RHCE-Lab-Environment)

#### Using a VM on a VM!

We may use a virtual machine on a Red Hat VM:

```bash
# see what virtual machines exist on the system
virsh list --all
# install Virtual Machine Manager
yum -y  install virt-manager
virt-manager
```

We can then play and then open the VM. At this point we realise that we don't have the password. Reboot the machine and on the lit of kernels, choose the first one and enter `e`: 

```bash
# at the end the line starting linux16 add rd.break
# ctrl + x
# mount the /sysroot directory
mount -o remount,rw /sysroot/
# make new root environment
chroot /sysroot
# set root password
passwd root
# ensure SELinux relabels the system when it boots
touch .autorelabel
exit
mount - remount,ro /sysroot/
logout
```
